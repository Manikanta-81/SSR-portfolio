    description:
      "Want to join two components securely while allowing flexibility in movement? The knuckle joint is the perfect solution! Designed for transmitting forces under tension or compression. A knuckle joint is a mechanical assembly that connects two cylindrical rods under tensile or compressive forces. It is commonly used where a small amount of angular movement is required.\n\nApplications:\n✍ Automobile steering linkages\n✍ Railway couplings\n✍ Tie rods\n✍ Lifting mechanisms\n\nKnuckle joints are widely used in mechanical and structural applications due to their durability and load-bearing capabilities. They provide a simple yet effective way to connect rods while allowing controlled movement.\n\nEngineering is all about finding efficient solutions to complex problems. The knuckle joint exemplifies this with its robust design and versatility.\n\nLet's continue to innovate and improve our engineering solutions!",
