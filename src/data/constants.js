It draws in atmospheric air, compresses it, mixes it with fuel, ignites the mixture, and then rapidly expels hot gases to produce forward motion. How It‚Äôs Different from Others:- Unlike Rocket Engines, which carry their own oxidizer, Air Jet Engines rely on atmospheric air for combustion, making them efficient for high-speed, long-distance travel in the atmosphere. Working Principle:- 1. Intake: Air is drawn in and compressed. 2. Compression: The air is pressurized using compressors. 3. Combustion: Fuel is mixed and ignited, producing high-pressure, high-temperature gas. 4. Exhaust: Gases are expelled at high speed, generating¬†thrust.",

The 1-cylinder vertical oscillating steam engine works on the principle of converting steam energy into mechanical work through a simple and compact mechanism. In this design, steam enters the cylinder through a fixed port in the engine base. As the piston moves up and down due to steam pressure, the entire cylinder oscillates (pivots) around a pin to alternately align the inlet and exhaust ports. This eliminates the need for a separate valve system. The reciprocating motion of the piston is transferred to the crankshaft via a connecting rod, which in turn rotates the flywheel, producing rotary motion",
